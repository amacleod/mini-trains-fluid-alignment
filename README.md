Mini Trains Fluid Alignment
===========================

Mini Trains Fluid Alignment is a Factorio mod that aims to allow fluid
pumps to work with Mini Trains even in mods that add new pumps, such
as Nullius. This mod blindly updates the alignment tolerance for all
pumps, so it might be incompatible with mods that add new pump types
and also need to modify the alignment tolerance. So far it has only
been tested with Nullius.
